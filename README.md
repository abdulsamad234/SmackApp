# What is Smack?

It is a little app i whipped up in xcode using swift 4, i was trying to build a slack clone, hence the name slcak :D

I really want to push it further and help entry level iOS developers get into open source development.

It works by using web socket and the back end is hosted on heroku. The back end is an API built by the devslopes team.

# How it works and every part of the app and how to modify them in the code
